# Rainbow Fluids Mod

Minecraft 1.16.5 Mod: Rainbow water from dyes
![java_F7ev8cTlDE](https://github.com/suchipi/mcmod-rainbow-fluids/assets/1341513/d9d92b39-477b-4230-91fd-eac1492de844)

You craft them from bucket+ice+dye, or using [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create)'s mixer

Only for Minecraft 1.16.5 because I created it for a 1.16.5 modpack. You can fork it and edit it if you'd like to update it to a newer version
